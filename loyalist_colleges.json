  "General Education Electives\nThe Ministry of Colleges and Universities requires all students in diploma and advanced diploma programs to successfully complete a minimum of three General Education electives to graduate. According to the Framework for Programs of Instruction, \"General Education strengthens student\u2019s [sic] generic skills, such as critical analysis, problem solving, and communication, in the context of an exploration of topics with broad-based personal and/or societal importance\u201d (Framework for Programs of Instruction, Revised July 2009, p. 21).\nShould you neglect to complete three GNED electives during your program of study in the semesters determined by your program you will be required to make these up at an additional cost in order to graduate.\nEach program determines in which semesters the Gen Ed electives are included and students can self-enrol through the Gen Ed Registration Portal on\n[myLoyalist](https://www.myloyalist.com). These electives are included in the tuition fees for the specific semesters and failure to take them according to the program map can result in delayed graduation. Taking any course off cycle from the program map results in an overage of hours in a future semester and additional fees.
